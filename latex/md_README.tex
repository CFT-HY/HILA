H\+I\+LA (lattice in Finnish) is a C++ lattice field theory programming framework, aimed at H\+PC simulations. ~\newline


Purpose\+: make writing applications straightforward and intuitive, while producing optimized executables for different (super)computing platforms (parallelization with M\+PI, G\+PU computing with Cuda or H\+IP, A\+VX vectorization, etc.). Details of the parallelization and computing architecture are hidden from the user\textquotesingle{}s view, and all applications automatically run on present or future platform. Write once -- run anywhere.

Hila is based on H\+I\+LA preprocessor \char`\"{}hilapp\char`\"{}, which is a C++ source-\/to-\/source transformer using the \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html}{\texttt{ libtooling}} toolbox of the \href{https://clang.llvm.org/}{\texttt{ Clang}} compiler. It converts application C++ to platform-\/specific C++ code, which is passed to appropriate compilers for the platforms.

Simplistic functionality which H\+I\+LA promises is for example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Field<Complex<double>> f;}
\DoxyCodeLine{Field<double> g = 0;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{onsites(ALL) f[X].gaussian\_random();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{foralldir(d)\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  g[ALL] += abs(f[X+d] -\/ 2*f[X] + f[X-\/d]);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Above we have created a random gaussian field and then interated over it with some operation that holds neighboring communication. We then store the result in a field initialized to zero.

Hilapp handles the expansion of the above code into valid c++ code. Behind the scenes H\+I\+LA takes care of M\+PI layout and communications. It lays out the lattice fields differently for different computing platforms\+: \textquotesingle{}array of structures\textquotesingle{} (standard), \textquotesingle{}array of structures of vectors\textquotesingle{} (A\+V\+X-\/type), or \textquotesingle{}structure of arrays\textquotesingle{} (G\+P\+U-\/type).\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{Installation and documentation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md17}
