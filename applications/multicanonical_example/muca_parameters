# This is a parameter file for CAM (Cubic Anisotropy Model) simulation
# controlling the iteration of the weight function.

# These control what is to be done to the weight function. If preloaded,
# it can be either further iterated with the given parameters or a new
# one can be created.

# Generic options
weight_file_location      NONE    # = NONE | <file_path>
iteration_method          direct  # = direct | direct_smooth | canonical
hard_walls 	              NO      # = NO | YES
max_OP                    0.6     #
min_OP                    -0.6    # the order param is divided into `number_of_bins` of bins in the interval [`min_OP`, `max_OP`].
number_of_bins            60      #
iteration_visuals         NO      # = YES | NO

# Direct iteration method (DI)
DI_finish_condition       all_visited  # = all_visited | ends_visited
DI_sample_size            100          # Cumulate this many samples before updating weights
DI_single_check_interval  100          # used to limit check interval if `DI sample size` = 1
DI_C_init                 0.1          # the initial modification factor `C`
DI_C_min                  0.001        # the minimum modification factor `C` when reached iteration stops

# Canonical iteration method (CI)
CI_sample_size            100         # Cumulate this many samples before updating weights
CI_initial_bin_hits       5           # Bins are initialised with this many hits
