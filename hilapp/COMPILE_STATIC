Statically linked hilapp is needed if the target machine does not
have all needed clang/llvm development tools installed.  This is unfortunately
the case for many supercomputers.

In this case you can compile statically linked hilapp on your workstation
where the development tools are easy to install (see HOWTO_GET_CLANG).
Statically linked hilapp should work on the target machine (of course,
provided that machines are binary compatible, usually both x86_64).

- Compile hilapp:

> cd hila/hilapp
> make [-j4] static 

  This results in statically linked program build/hilapp

- Install hila source package on target machine (e.g. with git)

- Copy hilapp executable to the directory hila/hilapp/bin 
  on the target machine.

- Test:
> hilapp/bin/hilapp --help
