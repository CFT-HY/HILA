Statically linked "hilapp" may be needed if the target machine does not
have clang/llvm development packages installed.  Then you may compile
"hilapp" with static linking and copy the executable to the target
platform (provided that both machines are binary compatible)

- Obtain the sources and compile clang/llvm according to the instructions in
HOWTO_GET_CLANG.  Note that the binary distributions usually do not
include .a -libraries which are needed for static linking.

- Compile hilapp with Makefile_src.

- Install hila source package to target machine (e.g. with git)

- Copy "hilapp" executable AND the directory "clang_include"
from hila/hilapp/build -directory in the machine where the compilation was done
to hila/hilapp/build -directory in the target machine.
"clang_include" is originally a symlink, but it should be copied to a "real" directory.
