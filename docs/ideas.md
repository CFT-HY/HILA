# Ideas for documentation

## Datatypes

- Each Datatype should list what it is assignment compatible with.

Common methods and functions:

- should we split field?

- other features as own titles

- add these:
  - reflect
  - gaussian_random?

- Finish mathematical operations
  - * **Lattice operation:** is this a good category?

- Should diagonalMatrix operator += be in diagonal matrix class?

## Input and output

- pretty_print and to_string
